Phuzzy
======

This is a PHP fuzzer. Fuzzing is a technique of finding bugs by generating
random function calls.

This script needs an sqlite database containing function information. This
database can be obtained from http://doc.php.net/downloads/sqlite/php_manual_en.sqlite.

(Code is dirty as this is mainly for personal use, sorry.)
